# Project: Personality Test with Dynamic Question Flow

This project builds a web application that guides users through a series of personality-related questions. The sequence of questions adapts based on the user's responses, offering a more personalized experience.

**Technologies:**

- Front-end: React
- Back-end: Node.js with Express

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js (version 14 or later recommended)
- npm (or yarn) package manager

**Local Setup:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prashant2002pd/Assignment2.git
   cd personality-test
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   - **Frontend:**

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install (or yarn install)
     ```

   - **Backend:**

     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install (or yarn install)
     ```

3. **Run the application:**

   - **Frontend:**

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm run dev
     ```

   - **Backend:**

     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm run dev
     ```

   This will typically start the front-end development server ( at `http://localhost:5173`) and the back-end server on a separate port ( at `http://localhost:3000`).
